BuddhaNexus will publish the textual matches of the various languages and textual corpora gradually, as work progresses. It will also keep on improving the algorithms so as to improve the results of both the monolingual textual matches and their respective translingual alignments. For the upload of new data, major improvements of existing functions, and introduction of new functions, see [News](./news). In general, the biggest challenge has been to set “gold standards” in order to get the best results, on the one hand, and avoid “noise,” on the other. While striving to optimize the default “gold standards,” BuddhaNexus understands that such standards may fluctuate depending on the text under inquiry, research questions, and personal interests, so it allows the user to manually set several of the parameters. Moreover, in order to facilitate analyses from different perspectives, several view options are possible.

The textual corpora used in BuddhaNexus were obtained from various institutions (for details, see the [Introduction page](./introduction)). Due to the huge amount of material, there has been no attempt by BuddhaNexus to improve the quality of the texts (e.g. removing typos and the like). Occasionally, however, some minor changes to the texts were made for technical reasons (e.g. standardization of transliterations or formats). As our algorithms search for approximate (and not exact) matches, we believe that in most cases variants resulting from typos, or from different orthographies and the like, should not pose major problems in detecting textual matches.

## Enter the Database

In order to enter the database, select the language of your choice by either clicking on the respective symbol on the homepage or selecting it from the top menu bar, under “Database.”

### Submit an Inquiry

In order to submit an inquiry select a text from the menu, which offers an overview of the available texts according to thematic sections of various kinds, or use the search field to find a specific text. Once the matches have been generated, you can view them by either scrolling down and up or by selecting the passage you are interested in by selecting the respective folio, facsimile, sutta or segment number from the dropdown list in the settings menu on the right (under Options). You can change texts by clicking the "Change Text" button on the right side above the text, which opens a sidebar on the left, which again offers an overview of the available texts according to thematic sections.

### Global Text Search

The Global Text Search offers a search by a text passage. Upon typing in a text passage (max. length 150 characters), a list with the pertinent hits will be displayed. A click on any of the results will display the full text in the Text View mode. The total number of possible search results is limited to 1000 items. It is possible to apply a filter to these results to limit the results to a specific language, or to include or exclude text(s).

### Filter Options

- **Similarity Score:** Uses string edit distance as a base for calculation. These can vary between 0 and 100%. The value 100 means a perfect match, while a lower value indicates less similarity. The default value varies from one language to another.
- **Minimum character/syllable matches length:** Filters by minimum length of the matches based on the match’s number of characters, excluding punctuation signs. The default value varies from one language to another.
- **Exclude Sources:** Does not display the matches found in the excluded text(s).
- **Incude Sources:** Displays the matches found only in the selected text(s).

### View options

- **Text View**: Upon selecting a text, the entire Inquiry Text with the passages for which matches are found is shown. The presence of matches in the Inquiry Text is indicated by colours. To view the matches use the scrollbar or select a passage by selecting the respective folio, facsimile, sutta or segment number from the dropdown list in the settings menu on the right (under Options). Clicking on any of the coloured positions will show the matches found in various Hit Texts for that position in a new column. By clicking on any of these matches the respective Hit Text will be displayed in yet another column, with the match in question highlighted. All matches with the Inquiry Text found in the displayed Hit Text are coloured. To display the Hit Text in a new tab, click the number of the respective text in the last selected match in the middle column.
- **Table View**: Displays a table of the matches found for the current Inquiry Text. The results can be sorted in four different ways: (1) by their position in the Inquiry Text, (2) by their position in the Hit Text(s), (3) by the length of the match in the Inquiry Text, and (4) by the length of the match in the Hit Text.
- **Numbers View**: Displays a table with the segment numbers of the matches found for the current Inquiry Text. This view mode is only available for Pāli and Chinese texts, where the segment numbers represent the PTS and Taisho numbers, respectively.
- **Graph View**: Displays various graphs visualizing the (approximate) matches found for the Inquiry Text. The pie graph displays the distribution of the (approximate) matches according to the various text collections. The distribution chart shows the distribution of the top texts that have matches with the Inquiry Text based on the accumulated length of the approximate matches. A maximum of 50 Hit Texts are shown.

### Links

BuddhaNexus makes effort to provide useful links of various kinds. These include, whenever possible, links of the individual texts to the websites from which the digital texts were obtained and to websites offering cataloguing data. Currently links with the following websites are available: <a href="https://tipitaka.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VRI</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SuttaCentral</a> for Pāli, <a href="http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GRETIL</a> and <a href="http://www.dsbcproject.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSBC</a> for Sanskrit, <a href="https://www.bdrc.io/buda-archive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BUDA</a> and <a href="https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/rktsneu/sub/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rKTs</a> for Tibetan, and <a href="https://cbeta.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBETA</a> and <a href="https://dazangthings.nz/cbc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC@</a> for Chinese.

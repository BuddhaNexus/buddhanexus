## August 4, 2021: Major updates of BuddhaNexus

We are happy to announce several major updates of BuddhaNexus, as follows:

1.  First and foremost the Sanskrit corpus has been considerably enlarged and now also contains the collection of the <a href="http://www.dsbcproject.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon (DSBC, University of the West)</a>, and a few other texts obtained from <a href="https://suttacentral.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SuttaCentral</a>. The Sanskrit collection has been accordingly reorganized. For practical and structural reasons, the corpus of Buddhist texts is thematically arranged in accordance with the organizational scheme of the Tibetan Buddhist Canon. An overview of the new organization can be found in the sidebar upon clicking the triple bar symbol situated on the left side of the menu bar of the Sanskrit category.
2.  Another major update has been the publication of multilingual matches of Sanskrit texts with their Tibetan translations. The multilingual data has been **automatically generated**. Accordingly, the multilingual alignments are currently only offered to those texts for which relatively good results could be achieved.
3.  On the Pāli side, a new “English mode” was introduced. This view mode displays the Pāli text together with a **machine translation** into English created by the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transformer machine learning model</a>. This model is based on English translations by Bhikkhu Sujato (Suttas) or Bhikkhu Bhahmali (Vinaya) that were made available by SC. Additionally, the original English SC translations are also offered whenever available. Note that the machine- made translations merely aim at facilitating research and should by no means be considered definite.
4.  We have also widen our cooperation in terms of linking to other databases. Currently links with the following websites are available: <a href="https://tipitaka.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VRI</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SuttaCentral</a> for Pāli, <a href="http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GRETIL</a>, <a href="http://www.dsbcproject.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSBC</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SuttaCentral</a> for Sanskrit, <a href="https://www.bdrc.io/buda-archive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BUDA</a> and <a href="https://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/rktsneu/sub/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rKTs</a> for Tibetan, and <a href="https://cbeta.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBETA</a>, <a href="https://dazangthings.nz/cbc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBC@</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SuttaCentral</a> for Chinese.

We are currently working on further updates, which will be announced in due time.

## January 19, 2021: Major update of the BuddhaNexus database

We are happy to announce a major update of the BuddhaNexus database. The Tibetan corpus has been enlarged and contains now the two paracanonical collections of the rNying ma rgyud ’bum (based on the 56-vols. modern edition) and the rNying ma bka’ ma (based on the 133 vols. modern edition). The files do not contain page numbers yet, but we hope to be able to supplement them in the near future.
This update also includes links to BUDA (at BDRC) of the bKa’ ’gyur and bsTan ’gyur texts. Links to the rKTs will be provided soon.
We are currently working on further updates, including enlarging the Sanskrit corpus to include texts from the Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon (DSBC) and other projects, and generating translingual matches.

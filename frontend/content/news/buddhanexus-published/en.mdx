We are happy to announce the online publication of the BuddhaNexus database at <a href="https://buddhanexus.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://buddhanexus.net/</a>.

BuddhaNexus, a collaborative project of the Khyentse Center, Universität Hamburg, is a database devoted to the study of Buddhist texts and literary corpora in Pāli, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese—with particular emphasis on evolution of scriptures, formation of canons, and intellectual networks—by way of locating textual matches within various Buddhist literary corpora and texts. The current version includes material in Pāli, Tibetan, and Chinese. Sanskrit material will be published soon.

Several other features are being currently developed, including linking to other databases and generating translingual matches.

Maniratana Bunnag Dhamma Society Fund, 2005. Based on the digital edition of the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana published by the <0>Vipassana Research Institute (VRI)</0>, with corrections and proofreading by the Dhamma Society.",
  "p02": "The Sutta, Vinaya, and Abhidhamma texts have been sourced from the <0>SuttaCentral JSON-based segmented texts (Bilara)</0>, which have been extensively tested to ensure integrity and correctness. These texts have the same segment numbers as in <1>SuttaCentral</1> and are linked to the corresponding segments on that site.",
  "p03": "The remaining commentary texts of the Aṭṭhakathā, Tikā, and Anya have been sourced from the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana as published by the Vipassana Research Institute.",
  "p04": "For the calculation of the Pāli matches, SuttaCentral’s hyphenation and stemming algorithms have been used. The minimum match length used in the calculations is 30 characters. We believe that shorter matches are not useful for the purpose of finding parallels.",
